Foundations of Frontend Web Development

------------ PROJECT no. 1 ------------
For the first project, I have decided to make a website that would serve as a mediator between clients and manufacurers. Specifically, it focuses on track-oriented automotive parts, recommended and produced by world-renowned brands.

-The site includes links for partners, as well as a small showcase of products, all done using links, images and paragraph text.
-Styling is achieved using Bootstrap, as well as CSS and SCSS. This combination creates a professional and user-friendly appearance.
-The logic wasn't the first priority, however in order for some functionalities to work, there had been added small chunks of JavaScript code, mainly to keep the usability of certain buttons and forms.
-A form, depicted as a 'Join us' page, uses simple elements combined in a way that offers validation.
-Navbar and footer where added, one of which is fixed to the viewport and the other on the page. They're responsive, allowing fo reasy navigation throughout the site.
-The site is built to bode well across many different viewports.
-A modal is added (as per request), with simple anchor functionalities and basic styling.
-Purely for aesthetic purposes, some animations and transitions were added, to make the content look more pleasing and done in a quality way.
