Foundations of Frontend Web Development

------------ PROJECT no. 1 ------------
For the first project, I have decided to make a website that would serve as a mediator between clients and manufacurers. Specifically, it focuses on track-oriented automotive parts, recommended and produced by world-renowned brands.

-The site includes links for partners, as well as a small showcase of products, all done using links, images and paragraph text.
-Styling is achieved using Bootstrap, as well as CSS and SCSS. This combination creates a professional and user-friendly appearance.
-The logic wasn't the first priority, however in order for some functionalities to work, there had been added small chunks of JavaScript code, mainly to keep the usability of certain buttons and forms.
-A form, depicted as a 'Join us' page, uses simple elements combined in a way that offers validation.
-Navbar and footer where added, one of which is fixed to the viewport and the other on the page. They're responsive, allowing fo reasy navigation throughout the site.
-The site is built to bode well across many different viewports.
-A modal is added (as per request), with simple anchor functionalities and basic styling.
-Purely for aesthetic purposes, some animations and transitions were added, to make the content look more pleasing and done in a quality way.

------------ PROJECT no. 2 ------------

Project #2 demonstrates the creation of a responsive web application with a focus on integrating dynamic content and interactive features using JavaScript and jQuery. The application showcases various functionalities aimed at enhancing user experience, including robust form validations and data handling through AJAX requests to JSON sources. This project highlights the practical application of client-side scripting, asynchronous data retrieval, and API integration to deliver a rich, user-friendly interface.

-Interactive Gallery: Users can click on thumbnails to view larger images within modal windows, enhancing the visual experience.
-Content Toggle: Implemented buttons and links that toggle the visibility of content sections, such as FAQs and product descriptions.
-Theme Switcher: Added functionality for users to switch between different theme colors, improving accessibility and personalization.
-Accordion Menu: Developed an accordion-style menu for FAQs and product categories, providing an intuitive navigation experience.
-Advanced Form Validation: Extended the contact form with new fields and detailed validations, ensuring accurate data entry and user feedback using the jQuery validation library.
-Data-Driven Content: Loaded dynamic content, such as blog posts and product listings, from JSON files via AJAX, simulating server-side data fetching.
-Form Submission with AJAX: Implemented form submission with AJAX, displaying success messages upon data saving.
-Notifications: Utilized toastr messages to provide users with instant feedback for success or error events.
-Single Page Application: Structured the web application as a single page application using spapp, enhancing the speed and fluidity of navigation.
-View More Option: Added a "View More" option to open detailed content within a new page.
-Edit and Delete Options: Simulated edit and delete functionalities for entities fetched from JSON files, with success messages displayed upon action confirmation.

------------ PROJECT no. 3 ------------

The objective of this project is to build a responsive Single Page Application (SPA) using ReactJS and styled with Material UI components. The application will serve as a platform to showcase an example of a car review blog.

-Functionality
The application includes multiple sections/pages that are navigated through without page reloads, providing a smooth user experience.
It is designed to be fully responsive, ensuring seamless interaction across various devices and screen sizes.
-Components
The UI is developed using functional components, leveraging React hooks such as useState and useEffect for state management and side effects.
-Routing
React Router is implemented to facilitate navigation between different sections/pages within the SPA, allowing users to easily explore the content.
-UI Components
Material UI components are extensively used for the UI design, including Buttons, Cards, AppBar, Toolbars, and Dialogs, enhancing the visual appeal and usability of the application.
-Custom Theme
Material UI's theming capabilities are utilized to customize the color scheme, typography, and overall look and feel of the application, providing a cohesive and branded experience.
-Layout
Material UI's Grid system is employed to create a responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring optimal display and readability of content.
-Form with Validation
The application includes a contact form with basic validation, demonstrating form handling in React. Users are guided through the form submission process, ensuring accurate data entry and user feedback.

By implementing these features and functionalities, the project aims to deliver a modern and user-friendly SPA that effectively showcases the desired content while providing a seamless browsing experience.
