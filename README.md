Foundations of Frontend Web Development

------------ PROJECT no. 1 ------------
For the first project, I have decided to make a website that would serve as a mediator between clients and manufacurers. Specifically, it focuses on track-oriented automotive parts, recommended and produced by world-renowned brands.

-The site includes links for partners, as well as a small showcase of products, all done using links, images and paragraph text.
-Styling is achieved using Bootstrap, as well as CSS and SCSS. This combination creates a professional and user-friendly appearance.
-The logic wasn't the first priority, however in order for some functionalities to work, there had been added small chunks of JavaScript code, mainly to keep the usability of certain buttons and forms.
-A form, depicted as a 'Join us' page, uses simple elements combined in a way that offers validation.
-Navbar and footer where added, one of which is fixed to the viewport and the other on the page. They're responsive, allowing fo reasy navigation throughout the site.
-The site is built to bode well across many different viewports.
-A modal is added (as per request), with simple anchor functionalities and basic styling.
-Purely for aesthetic purposes, some animations and transitions were added, to make the content look more pleasing and done in a quality way.

------------ PROJECT no. 2 ------------

Project #2 demonstrates the creation of a responsive web application with a focus on integrating dynamic content and interactive features using JavaScript and jQuery. The application showcases various functionalities aimed at enhancing user experience, including robust form validations and data handling through AJAX requests to JSON sources. This project highlights the practical application of client-side scripting, asynchronous data retrieval, and API integration to deliver a rich, user-friendly interface.

-Interactive Gallery: Users can click on thumbnails to view larger images within modal windows, enhancing the visual experience.
-Content Toggle: Implemented buttons and links that toggle the visibility of content sections, such as FAQs and product descriptions.
-Theme Switcher: Added functionality for users to switch between different theme colors, improving accessibility and personalization.
-Accordion Menu: Developed an accordion-style menu for FAQs and product categories, providing an intuitive navigation experience.
-Advanced Form Validation: Extended the contact form with new fields and detailed validations, ensuring accurate data entry and user feedback using the jQuery validation library.
-Data-Driven Content: Loaded dynamic content, such as blog posts and product listings, from JSON files via AJAX, simulating server-side data fetching.
-Form Submission with AJAX: Implemented form submission with AJAX, displaying success messages upon data saving.
-Notifications: Utilized toastr messages to provide users with instant feedback for success or error events.
-Single Page Application: Structured the web application as a single page application using spapp, enhancing the speed and fluidity of navigation.
-View More Option: Added a "View More" option to open detailed content within a new page.
-Edit and Delete Options: Simulated edit and delete functionalities for entities fetched from JSON files, with success messages displayed upon action confirmation.
